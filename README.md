## Introduction
Flipkart doesn't currently have any features that let you share your shopping list or cart with friends or family. Because of the various factors outlined below, users frequently desire to share their shopping cart contents with others so they can check out in their place. There are people who are financially dependent on their family members for ordering for them. Instead of sharing each product item. That is a very hectic process. You can share the whole cart items/address in a single click. In order to take advantage of some incentives that are only available after reaching a certain price threshold. This feature can provide a quick solution for all the above problems.

Develop a solution that allows the following functionalities-
<li> Allow user to share the cart with one or more other users
<li>Allow user to view the shared carts
<li>Allow the user to remove the shared cart access
